# Dynamics-of-Serial-Dependence
Following these 3 steps to run the 'MAIN_*' codes:

1) Download the zip file that includes all data and code from github. Place it wherever you like and extract it.
   - You should have one main directory named 'Dynamics-of-Serial-Dependence' that includes 3 directories (ie Data, Functions, & Results) and 2 code files (ie MAIN_AdaptiveParadigm, & MAIN_RegularParadigm).

2) Make sure you have the toolbox 'psignifit' on your computer, or download it from the following link (and add to matlab paths): https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit/archive/master.zip
   - This is the version (psignifit 4) we used in this study.

3) Open and run the m file MAIN_AdaptiveParadigm (or MAIN_RegularParadigm) to analyze the data in the adaptive paradigm (or the regular paradigm).
   - The calculated results and plotted figures will be saved in the Results folder.
